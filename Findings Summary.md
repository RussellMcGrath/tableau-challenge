### Investigation 1 - Effects of the Pandemic<br>
#### ...on total trips:<br>
* Trips decreased overall from 2019 to 2020<br>
* Trip decreased dramatically at the start of the pandemic (March-April), but mostly recovered by the summer.<br>
#### ...on customer subscription type:
* The percentage of subscriber customers (vs pay-per-use) decreased in 2020 from 2019.<br>
* This is likely due to the fact that customers tend to use the subscriber model when they are certain in their usage. There was very little certainty in 2020.<br>
### Investigation 2 - Effects of Bike Station Proximity to the Subway<br>
* In Manhattan, proximity to a subway station had little to no effect on the volume of trips from a given bike station.<br>
### Investigation 3 - City Official Map - Round Trip Analysis<br>
* Round trips are very uncommon overall.<br>
* Locations with relatively high round trip rates include:<br>
   * Scenic location with few stations nearby (Governor's Island, Randall's Island, Prospect Park)<br>
   * The Bronx as a whole, which has lower household income rates compaired to the other boroughs.<br>
